# Lua scripts

This is the source code for my lua scripts.

These scripts are **not intended to be run as is**, but be preprocessed via my website. 
What you see here is the dev versions I run that do not have autoupdates and are not intended for end users. You will not get help using the raw source.

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests, but there is no guarentee I will accept them, best to ask on the guilded.

Use https://jackz.me/stand/get-lua.php?script=SCRIPT_NAME_HERE_NO_EXT&source=manual&branch=master to download the preprocessed file

Exmaple: https://jackz.me/stand/get-lua.php?script=jackz_vehicle_builder&source=repo&branch=master

## Branches

release - The public version that all end users download from
master - The main development branch where breaking changes may occur
