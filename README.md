# Lua scripts

This is the source code for my lua scripts.

These scripts are **not intended to be run as is**, but be preprocessed via my website. 
What you see here is the dev versions I run that do not have autoupdates and are not intended for end users. You will not get help using the raw source.
The base scripts (non pre-processed) do not include auto-updates, version changelogs, the Script Meta menu, or automatic downloading of missing files.

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to the `release` branch, or ask about them on the guilded.

Use https://jackz.me/stand/get-lua.php?script=SCRIPT_NAME_HERE_NO_EXT&source=manual&branch=master to download the preprocessed file.
Use 'source=repo' to have a version that does not have any automatic updating logic.

Exmaple: https://jackz.me/stand/get-lua.php?script=jackz_vehicle_builder&source=manual&branch=master

## Branches
