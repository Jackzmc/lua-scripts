Copy whole lib folder to %appdata%\Stand\Lua Scripts\ 
and copy any of the .lua files below you want to the Lua Scripts folder:

no_police_helicopters:
	Deletes all police ai helicopters (not players, or empty)
	
train_control:
	Allows spawning trains, setting speeds, turning on derailed, delete all, etc.
	Warning: Negative speeds make train go in reverse, for other players this looks VERY buggy and desyncs a lot.
	Warning: Also due to nature of GTA, the closest person to the locomotive usually gets control of the train, which will fight your control of the train and it's speed.

vehicle_options (v1.5):
	Adds the following options under a players -> player name -> vehicle options:
	* Teleport Vehicle to Me
	* Teleport Vehicle to Me (Far Distance) - Smart version that tps players that are far away. Use if above option doesnt work.
	* Repair Vehicle
	* Burst Tires
	* Movement >
		* Boost <mph speed>
		* Slingshot (boost + launch)
		* Launch <mph speed>
	* Flip Upright
	* Kill Engine
	* Toggle Godmode
	* Set License Plate
	* [activate on last Vehicle] - uses their last vehicle (if they leave vehicle you can still mess with it) 
	
vehicle_autodrive:
	Not as polished as other scripts, allows you to set speed/driving style of ai,
	and have it either drive to waypoint or wander.
	
actions (v1.0):
	Allows you to play any scenario or animation on your character,
	147 scenarios to choose from
	15,353 animation groups with a total of 156,119 animations
	Animations has a search for animation groups, later versions I'll pick out the usual animations other menus have.
