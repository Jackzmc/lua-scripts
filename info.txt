	Deletes all police ai helicopters (not players, or empty)

	Allows spawning trains, setting speeds, turning on derailed, delete all, etc.
	Warning: Negative speeds make train go in reverse, for other players this looks VERY buggy and desyncs a lot.
	Warning: Also due to nature of GTA, the closest person to the locomotive usually gets control of the train, which will fight your control of the train and it's speed.
